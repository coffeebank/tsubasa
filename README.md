## Why Tsubasa

Tsubasa was created as a proof-of-concept for a ffmpeg-wasm implementation.

Tsubasa works locally on your device. Most services require uploading a video to someone's server, which takes time to upload -> process -> download, as well as pricey server costs for the hoster to process your videos. You never have to trust Tsubasa with your videos because it is all done locally.

## Development

Feel free to submit bugs and feature suggestions under Issues.
